# Dataset card: version 0.1.0

## Origin and use

I constructed this synthetic dataset for the fictional Northstar Telecom operator, using AI assistance to write scenarios and reference decisions. The dataset contains no private tickets, infrastructure inventory or operator procedures. Deterministic Python expands each regular scenario into 20 variations. “Authored” means written for this study, not drawn from real incident records. No domain specialist has certified the labels.

Use this release to develop adapters, test scoring, inspect failure modes, and pilot supervised training. Do not treat results as an estimate of real incident prevalence, production confidence calibration, or operational savings.

## Contents

There are 600 training, 220 validation, 220 test, and 24 challenge records. The regular sets comprise 30, 11 and 11 written scenario families respectively, with 20 realizations per family. Challenge records comprise 12 pairs across four intervention archetypes. A family is one scenario and its generated variations. Those variations are correlated. The 11-packet learning set contains the first validation packet from each family; it is a teaching subset, not a fifth split.

Each split has separate `.inputs.jsonl` and `.labels.jsonl` files. Inputs contain only an opaque ID, policy version and incident packet. Keys contain labels, accepted answers, rationales, generation metadata, and family identifiers. `manifest.json` records distributions and SHA-256 checksums.

Labels are `initial_owner`, `priority`, `next_check`, and `insufficient_evidence`. The current release uses one accepted answer per field. The evaluator supports multiple accepted decisions for correctness; probability scoring is skipped for fields with multiple accepted answers rather than inventing a target distribution.

## Construction and separation

The written evidence scenario determines the initial investigating domain and diagnostic action. A fictional policy determines priority from visible service impact. Cases lacking sufficient domain evidence explicitly remain with operations. None labels a confirmed physical root cause.

Scenario families are assigned to splits before realization. No family crosses splits. Topology IDs are disjoint and the common aggregation skeleton differs by split. Some independent-path graph shapes and policy language necessarily recur; this is not a guarantee of complete structural or semantic novelty. Realizations within a family share prose. Opaque IDs are excluded from model requests.

The priority task deliberately tests policy application to structured fields. A deterministic rule can solve it perfectly. It is not evidence that an AI model can independently infer customer impact.

Observations are narrative evidence summaries with occasional numeric measurements, not a physical simulation or complete raw telemetry. `observed_at` represents when the report is available; the prose may explicitly describe an older measurement. Topology excerpts are illustrative and may omit unaffected network elements. Synthetic observations can still contain technical simplifications or errors.

## Challenge interventions

- Change affected outage sites from nine to ten: priority must cross the policy boundary.
- Replace current power evidence with stale evidence: retain operations and gather fresh evidence.
- Add an irrelevant change-timing observation after independently verified recovery: disposition should remain monitoring.
- Remove all dependencies on an alarmed uplink: its alarm no longer justifies assigning the affected sites to transport.

Only the specified input field changes within each pair; IDs differ for scoring. No challenge archetype is used in training exports.

## Checks and limitations

The validator checks IDs, input/label correspondence, split-family separation, duplicate packets, timestamp availability, enum values, priority consistency, domain/action compatibility, pair-label relationships, and file checksums. These checks do not replace semantic review of the authored evidence.

Metrics include family-grouped bootstrap intervals, but 11 test families and four challenge archetypes are too few for strong generalization claims. The keyword baseline's high score indicates that much of this first release is straightforward. Larger independently written cases, realistic noisy notes, alternative diagnoses, and specialist review should precede model selection for operational use.

The runnable validator checks the public input records and answer-key rows. See `triage_bench/validate.py` for the implemented checks.

## Inspection and evaluation

The app joins inputs and keys for human inspection while keeping the keys out of inference. Original ML and Jev receive the same original state; revised ML and focused Jev receive the same compact state. Only ML fits on the 600 training packets. Five test and four challenge packets appeared in earlier runs, as disclosed in [the overview](experiment-overview.md).

Use [the data atlas](observatory.md) to inspect families and pairs, and [the evaluation plan](evaluation-plan.md) for score definitions. Raw KPI detection requires a separate dataset and experiment.

## Experiment 3 draft pack

The historical counts and definitions above remain unchanged. A separate `data/experiment-3-draft/` pack adds 72 training packets across 12 families and 36 development packets across nine disjoint families. Every pair changes one declared field. References remain provisional, and no new final held-out split exists. [The development guide](experiment-3-development.md#new-data) describes construction and review questions. Neither pack establishes real network representativeness.

## Question-precedence development pack

The subsequent `data/experiment-3-question-draft/` pack contains 16 further development packets in eight pairs across eight new written families. Six pairs change a draft decision; two test invariance. It has no training or held-out split. Both Jev arms receive identical combined evidence and differ only in three question instructions.

The references apply the user-selected teaching rule: keep NOC until current evidence links a fault to an affected service. The 15-minute window, conflict disposition and network realism remain unreviewed assumptions. The [question comparison](experiment-3-question-precedence.md) records exact changes and results. These families are now exposed development cases; later revisions need further cases.

## Conflict repetition pack

`data/experiment-3-conflict-draft/` adds eight development packets in four new written families. Each pair changes only the nominal measurement timestamp from current to stale. Three hosted repetitions do not create new incidents or independent families. The references, 15-minute window and instrument classifications remain unreviewed teaching assumptions. [The repetition guide](experiment-3-conflict-repetition.md) records the controls and results.

## Evidence-selection development pack

`data/experiment-3-selection-draft/` contains 12 packets in six new written families and decision-changing pairs. Three current-conflict controls pair with a stale nominal measurement; other pairs vary stale or unknown fault times or an excluded dependency relationship. The pack has no training or held-out split. References precede inference and remain provisional. [The selection guide](experiment-3-evidence-selection.md) explains filtering, source indices and the limits of these constructed instrument readings.
