# Northstar Telecom: learning from Jev, ML and rules

## Purpose

I am testing how Jev, a conventional machine learning (ML) classifier and simple rules support telecom incident decisions, and whether better inputs, clearer questions or software calculations address their failures.

The study starts with incident interpretation and the next diagnostic step, as preparation for workflows such as a RAN KPI analyzer or an intelligent field services agent. The lab uses the fictional Northstar Telecom network and recommends diagnostics without executing network changes. It interprets KPI anomalies described in incident summaries; raw time-series anomaly detection is a separate experiment.

Each approach makes four decisions:

| Decision | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Initial owner | The first investigating team: radio access network (RAN), transport, power, core services or the network operations center (NOC). |
| Priority | P1 to P4 under the fictional impact policy. |
| Next check | Inspect a domain, verify a change, gather evidence or monitor recovery. |
| Insufficient evidence | Whether current evidence is insufficient to choose an investigating domain or a defined monitoring disposition. |

### Policy example

The policy defines the decisions and the evidence they require. It tells the approaches to:

- Select an initial investigating team without claiming a confirmed root cause.
- Keep missing, stale or conflicting evidence with NOC. Gather current evidence, unless verifying a relevant change scope is the immediate next step.
- Assign P1 to an outage at 10 or more sites; P2 to an outage at 1–9 sites or degradation at 10 or more sites; P3 to other degradation or unknown impact; and P4 to no current unplanned impact.
- Recommend diagnostics only, without changing configurations or executing rollback.

For example, fresh evidence of scheduler task stalls at one degraded site supports `ran / P3 / inspect_radio / no`. If the supporting measurement becomes stale, NOC should gather current evidence. Priority still follows the current impact.

## Synthetic data

### Data construction

I wrote fictional incident scenarios and their expected decisions with AI assistance. “Authored” means written for this study: observations and service impact form the evidence; investigating team, next check and evidence sufficiency form the reference decisions. Neither the scenarios nor the answer keys come from real incident records.

For example, the radio scheduler scenario describes elevated scheduling delay, low resource occupancy, repeated task stalls and a healthy uplink. Its reference assigns RAN as the initial owner and radio inspection as the next check. The evaluation scores each approach against those choices.

A deterministic generator expands each regular scenario into 20 packets. It varies dates, identifiers, affected-site counts and presentation details while generally retaining the central evidence wording. It calculates priority from the fictional policy.

Each packet includes observations, report timestamps, impact, an illustrative topology and change information. Separate files hold the answer keys, rationales and family identifiers; model requests exclude them. The observations are narrative summaries, not simulated network measurements.

### What a family means

A **family** consists of one written scenario and its generated variations. The 20 scheduler records repeat the same underlying situation. Their owner and diagnostic references stay the same, while priority can change with affected-site count.

These are related examples, not 20 independent failure modes. A perfect family score shows consistency within that scenario, not performance across 20 different types of incident.

### Training, learning and evaluation sets

| Set | Records | Families or challenge types | Use |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Training | 600 | 30 families | Fit ML features and classifiers. |
| Validation | 220 | 11 families | Inspect failures and choose improvements. |
| Learning | 11 | 11 families | Explore one record from each validation family. These records already count toward validation. |
| Held-out test | 220 | 11 families | Check frozen approaches on different scenario families. |
| Paired challenge | 24 | 4 types | Evaluate 12 controlled pairs. |

The **learning set** is a teaching view of validation, not an additional independent evaluation set.

**Held-out** means kept out of training and tuning. ML fits only training records. Validation guides changes, which stay frozen during test evaluation. Regular training, validation and test families do not overlap, although some policy language and network structures recur.

Five test records and four challenge records had appeared in earlier runs. The full evaluations therefore check the frozen revisions but do not constitute an entirely untouched benchmark. Those failures now inform the next improvement round, which needs new evaluation cases.

A **paired challenge** changes one controlled factor and tests whether decisions change appropriately or stay stable when the added information is irrelevant.

| Controlled change | Expected behavior |
|---|---|
| Outage grows from nine sites to ten | Change priority from P2 to P1. |
| Supporting power measurements become stale | Retain NOC ownership and gather current evidence. |
| An unrelated change appears after verified recovery | Continue monitoring. |
| Affected sites stop depending on the alarmed uplink | Stop using that uplink alarm to justify transport ownership. |

Each type has three pairs. The 24 records cover four challenge types, not 24 independent failure modes.

### Is it representative of a real network?

**This is teaching data built around telecom incident themes. I have not established that it represents a real network.** The scenarios cover radio, transport, power, core services, maintenance and recovery. I chose their mix to exercise decisions, not to match observed incident frequencies.

The generated counts, simplified topologies and clean summaries lack calibration against network telemetry. They do not reproduce a measured mix of equipment, traffic, alarm bursts, delayed reports, incomplete notes or competing diagnoses. A telecom specialist has not validated the scenarios, policy or answer keys.

The dataset supports inspection of policy application and failures under controlled changes. Its scores do not estimate performance on real incidents. That will require specialist review and evaluation on independently labeled, anonymized incidents using the evidence available at each decision time.

## First experiment: establish the comparison

The first experiment compared three approaches on the same incident evidence and candidate decisions.

### Jev

Hosted `jev-1.13.0` received requests through the TypeSafe API. Each request contained a **state**, consisting of the policy and full incident packet, and four **Choice** questions with fixed options and descriptions. Jev returned its decisions, answer probabilities and a separate confidence value. The request format follows the [TypeSafe quickstart](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction/quickstart).

Jev received policy and evidence at inference time, without training or fine-tuning on the telecom labels.

### Rules

Keyword rules routed cases to power, core, transport and RAN, with explicit handling for selected missing-evidence, maintenance and recovery phrases. A separate rule calculated priority directly from impact status and site count.

The rules provided a comparison point for how much straightforward software could solve. They did not learn from examples or analyze full dependency paths.

### ML

Scikit-learn converted the same policy-and-incident state sent to Jev into TF-IDF features for individual words and two-word sequences. TF-IDF represents text numerically and weights terms that distinguish documents. See [scikit-learn’s text feature documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction).

Four logistic regression classifiers, one per decision, learned from the 600 training records. I fixed their settings before validation; vocabulary and classifier fitting used only training data.

ML learned the fictional task from labeled examples. Jev used an existing model with supplied policy and instructions, so the comparison does not assume equivalent training histories.

### Initial results

The initial evaluation covered the learning cases, then full validation. A record passes only when all four decisions match the accepted references. Failed or missing responses count as errors.

| Original approach | All four decisions correct: 220 validation records | Failed responses |
|---|---:|---:|
| Rules | 90.9% | 0 |
| ML | 58.6% | 0 |
| Jev | 49.1% | 5 |

ML chose the correct owner on every validation record but often missed priority and the maintenance-scope diagnostic. Jev also missed priority and sometimes requested more evidence despite a directly observed domain malfunction.

The app rejected five Jev responses because their probability distributions did not sum to one within its original tolerance. Those response-handling failures count against the score.

## Second experiment: improve the inputs and questions

Validation failures guided revisions to Jev’s requests and ML’s features. I kept the dataset, policy, reference answers and Jev checkpoint unchanged. ML fitting continued to use only the original training data.

### Jev input before and after

For scheduler case `NS-b073aba91088`, the compact request removed the duplicate ticket description and operator note, retained observations, impact, topology and change information, and added derived impact bands and report age.

These excerpts show the actual impact and observation fields. Both complete requests also contained the same policy text, topology and change record.

**Original state excerpt**

```json
{
  "service_impact": {
    "affected_sites": 1,
    "basis": "Current independent service checks",
    "status": "degraded"
  },
  "observations": [
    {
      "detail": "Scheduling delay is elevated despite low resource occupancy. The radio scheduler reports repeated task stalls; the site uplink is healthy.",
      "observed_at": "2026-01-22T21:37:00Z",
      "source": "Synthetic operations evidence feed"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Revised state excerpt**

```json
{
  "service_impact": {
    "affected_sites": 1,
    "basis": "Current independent service checks",
    "status": "degraded",
    "affected_sites_band": "one_to_nine"
  },
  "observations": [
    {
      "detail": "Scheduling delay is elevated despite low resource occupancy. The radio scheduler reports repeated task stalls; the site uplink is healthy.",
      "report_age_minutes": 1.0
    }
  ]
}
```

The transformation calculated the band and report age from existing counts and timestamps; the observation stayed the same. I did not supply any reference answers in the request. The revised state also explains that report age can differ from measurement age and that inventory alone does not prove a fault.

The revised questions and option descriptions made the decision criteria explicit. These excerpts show the actual instructions:

| Input | Original | Revised |
|---|---|---|
| Owner instruction | Which domain should initially investigate under the policy? | Choose the first investigating team using observations. This is NOT confirmed root cause. A directly observed malfunction is enough to begin domain investigation even if its exact cause is unknown. |
| Priority instruction | What is the incident priority under the supplied impact policy? | Apply ONLY service_impact.status and affected_sites_band. outage + ten_or_more => P1; outage + one_to_nine => P2; degraded + ten_or_more => P2; degraded + one_to_nine => P3; unknown => P3; none => P4. Do not use fault type or alarm severity. |
| Evidence instruction | Is evidence insufficient to select a unique investigating fault domain, using the policy definition? | Is current evidence insufficient to choose an initial investigating domain under the policy? Unknown exact root cause is NOT enough for yes. A directly observed domain malfunction is sufficient for no. |
| RAN option | Radio access: radio resource, interference, antenna, timing or mobility evidence. | Observed radio-access performance or hardware malfunction: scheduling, RF reception, antenna, interference, timing or mobility. |

The revised instructions also clarified the NOC option and when to verify a change, gather evidence or monitor recovery. In the walkthrough, **What changed** compares the packets and questions and exposes each complete request. In the comparison lab, **What Jev receives → Request version** shows the same variants.

| Saved response for this case | Owner | Priority | Next check | Insufficient evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Original Jev | `noc` | `P2` | `gather_evidence` | `no` |
| Jev · focused | `ran` | `P3` | `inspect_radio` | `no` |
| Reference | `ran` | `P3` | `inspect_radio` | `no` |

The original priority conflicted with the stated impact: one degraded site requires P3. The revised request made that mapping explicit. The original owner and diagnostic also conflicted with the directly observed scheduler malfunction. The RAN option now names scheduling, and the owner instruction explains that initial investigation does not require a proven root cause.

The experiment changed the state, questions and option descriptions together. This result establishes their combined improvement on this case, not the contribution of each individual change.

### How to identify the next Jev transformation

Start with the incorrect decision, read its policy rule and trace that rule to the input fields. Then check whether the request omits useful evidence, repeats it, requires a calculation or leaves the decision definition ambiguous.

| What to look for | Transformation to test | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A count requires comparison with a policy threshold | Calculate a named impact band in software and specify how the question uses it. | Included in experiment two. |
| Ticket text duplicates an observation | Keep one complete observation. Preserve any additional facts that occur only in the ticket. | Included in experiment two for these duplicate summaries. |
| The question asks for a unique fault domain, but the policy asks who should investigate first | Define evidence sufficiency in terms of the initial investigation. | Included in experiment two. |
| An option description omits the relevant evidence type | Include policy-supported evidence types, such as scheduling faults in the RAN description. | Included in experiment two. |
| A recent report contains an old measurement | Represent measurement time and report time separately; mark missing measurement time as unknown. | Next experiment. Current report age does not solve this. |
| An alarm names a faulty component, but its relationship to affected sites is unclear | Calculate dependency paths and provide whether the affected sites depend on that component, or whether the relationship is unknown. | Next experiment. |

For each candidate, change one element at a time and compare it with the unchanged request on the same validation cases. Include correct cases to detect regressions, keep the Jev checkpoint and policy fixed, and inspect both decisions and errors. Do not assume that shorter text or more instructions always helps.

Use the cases already reviewed to develop improvements. Then keep the revised input transformations and questions unchanged while evaluating them on new scenario families that were not used to develop the changes. This checks whether the improvements work beyond the familiar examples.

### ML and response handling

Revised ML received the same compact state as focused Jev, with added short character sequences and structured features for impact status, site-count band and their combination. The priority classifier learned from those impact features alone; the other three classifiers learned from text and structured features. Priority remained a learned classifier result.

The rules stayed unchanged. A separate score, **with software priority**, retained each model’s three contextual decisions and substituted the exact priority calculation, without overwriting its saved predictions.

The updated response handler normalizes only bounded rounding differences in two-decimal probabilities, including observed totals of 0.99, while retaining raw values. Larger or otherwise malformed distributions still fail. This fixes response handling, not selected decisions.

After validation review, I froze the revisions for the full comparison of all five approaches on validation, test and challenge. Reruns of the originals used the same updated response handler as focused Jev.

## Results

| Approach | Validation: 220 records | Test: 220 records | Challenge: 24 records | Both records correct: 12 pairs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Rules | 90.9% | 90.9% | 87.5% | 75.0% |
| ML · original | 58.6% | 59.5% | 16.7% | 0.0% |
| ML · revised | 86.4% | 96.8% | 58.3% | 50.0% |
| Jev · original, rerun | 50.9% | 57.7% | 79.2% | 58.3% |
| Jev · focused | 100.0% | 90.9% | 87.5% | 75.0% |

All full comparison runs completed without failed or missing responses. A pair passes only when all four decisions are correct on both sides of the controlled change.

Revised ML passed 213 of 220 test records; focused Jev passed 200. Jev’s perfect validation score did not carry across to test, and its challenge score matched the rules.

### Interpretation

**Priority accounts for much of the gain.** Software priority raises original ML’s test score from 59.5% to 79.1% and original Jev’s from 57.7% to 90.9%. Focused Jev also scores 90.9%, so its revision did not improve aggregate correctness of the other three test decisions. It did improve those decisions on validation and challenge.

**ML’s overall improvement includes regressions.** Validation owner accuracy fell from 100.0% to 86.4%. In some transport cases, revised ML fixed priority but changed a correct owner to power. Original ML with software priority beat revised ML on validation, 90.9% versus 86.4%, but that ordering reversed on test. Because the experiment combined several ML changes, the results cannot attribute each gain or regression to a single feature change.

**Some diagnostic references need review.** Revised ML still misses maintenance scope and some return-path transport cases. Focused Jev chooses `verify_change` rather than the reference `inspect_radio` on all 20 test variations involving a new neighbor relation, while getting owner, priority and evidence sufficiency right. I will ask a telecom specialist whether the reference should accept an alternative before defining the next evaluation set.

**Dependency reasoning remains weak.** Focused Jev assigns transport on three challenge variations after affected sites stop depending on the faulty uplink. On one case, it assigns 99% probability to that wrong owner. Revised ML also fails this challenge. High answer probability does not establish operational reliability.

The rules scores show how much of these written scenarios keywords and explicit policy can solve. These results guide further tests; they do not estimate production accuracy, restoration-time savings or establish a generally superior model.

## Next experiment

The [experiment 3 development comparison](experiment-3-development.md) now includes a separate draft pack, deterministic dependency and measurement-age facts, four matched local ML variants and 144 completed Jev requests. The policy, checkpoint and questions stayed fixed. References remain provisional; no final held-out set exists.

Dependency facts raise local ML all-four accuracy from 16.7% to 30.6%. For Jev, the compact baseline scores 44.4%; dependency facts score 41.7%, measurement facts 38.9% and both 41.7%. No Jev variant gets both packets right in any of the 14 decision-changing pairs. These small draft-set results do not support adopting either fact addition for Jev or comparing scores with experiment 2.

I will review the flagged references with a network specialist, especially whether an observed fault warrants domain investigation when its incident relationship is unknown, and whether insufficient evidence requires NOC ownership. The [reference review](experiment-3-reference-review.md) also identifies the unvalidated 15-minute telemetry window and conflict assumptions.

The [question-precedence comparison](experiment-3-question-precedence.md) now tests explicit relationship and freshness rules on 16 new packets with identical combined evidence. The user selected NOC retention until current evidence links a fault to an affected service. Original questions score 56.3%; explicit precedence scores 93.8%. One stale-conflict failure remains, including an owner regression. This supports further testing of the wording; references remain drafts and a single response per arm does not measure variability. The [subsequent conflict repetition](experiment-3-conflict-repetition.md) tests four new pairs three times without changing either question set. Explicit precedence repeats the stale-conflict failure throughout, despite correctly retaining NOC on every current conflict. The [evidence-selection comparison](experiment-3-evidence-selection.md) completed 36 requests on 12 further packets with explicit questions fixed. Combined facts and added eligibility facts each score 75.0%; selecting eligible observations scores 100.0%, fixing three stale-conflict packets and retaining nine controls. These draft results need specialist review and do not establish operational reliability.

The [selection-robustness check](experiment-3-selection-robustness.md) completed 48 calls on eight new packets, repeating both frozen inputs three times. Selected observations match all eight draft references in every repeat; combined facts match seven. Selection fixes one validity-boundary packet, repeated three times, and introduces no new wrong fields. Both inputs pass the partial-inventory, missing-inventory and multiple-domain controls and keep identical decisions across repeats. The multiple-domain reference remains provisional; agreement does not establish correctness or operational reliability.

The [structured ML comparison](experiment-3-structured-ml.md) fits four matched classifiers on 96 new training packets and scores 64 development packets. Both feature blocks together match 52/64 draft references versus 24/64 for the text baseline, with 20/32 versus 6/32 pairs correct. It fixes 28 complete packets and loses none, but introduces eight wrong owner fields and ten wrong diagnostic fields on already-failed packets. Current transport faults still receive NOC at about 85% probability. Jev makes no calls in this comparison.

The next development study will counterbalance fault and nominal wording while keeping feature construction and classifier settings fixed. Training uses “test” only in nominal readings; development also uses it for transport faults. New development families must check whether broader wording reduces that shortcut without losing freshness and dependency behavior. Specialist review remains necessary before final held-out evaluation.

Reviewed references, fixed transformations and questions must precede evaluation on new held-out families. The evaluation should measure individual decisions, both-packet accuracy, high-probability errors and regressions. Those results will determine whether to proceed to read-only diagnostic tools.

Raw KPI anomaly detection remains a separate experiment. That work will measure detection quality and false alarms before testing Jev’s interpretation of the detected evidence.

## Evidence

I checked these results against saved run records on September 30, 2026. The inference checkpoint is `6a44f62`. Later walkthrough and documentation changes preserve its four frozen inference files.

| Original and revised validation | `c3519f8c7ec84814` |
| Full test | `3739acf583a64c79` |
| Paired challenge | `908dac657e6740af` |

The [failure review](performance-review.md) includes individual cases and input fingerprints. The [dataset card](dataset-card.md) and [evaluation plan](evaluation-plan.md) record construction, limitations and scoring controls.

## Interactive inspection

The comparison app includes a study walkthrough whose eight chapters connect the data, methods, transformations and saved results. The case workbench follows **Evidence**, **Decisions** and **Inside an approach**, with **Paired change** for controlled comparisons. The local sandbox shows before/after choices without changing the original packet or recorded results.

[The walkthrough guide](observatory.md) explains the controls. Historical run files remain local and ignored by Git; a fresh clone can inspect the data and local models but needs those files to display the historical comparisons. [Verification](verification.md) records the current checks.
